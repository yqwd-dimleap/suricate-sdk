"""
Unit tests for agent status transitions.

Tests that the agent correctly transitions between execution states,
particularly focusing on transitions to RUNNING status when run() is called.

This addresses the fix for issue #865 where the agent status was not transitioning
to RUNNING when run() was called from IDLE state.

State transition matrix tested:
- IDLE -> RUNNING (when run() is called)
- PAUSED -> RUNNING (when run() is called after pause)
- WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION -> RUNNING (when run() is called to confirm)
- FINISHED -> IDLE -> RUNNING (when new message sent after completion)
- STUCK -> IDLE (when new message sent) -> RUNNING (when run() is called)
- STUCK -> RUNNING (when run() is called directly)
- FINISHED -> remain unchanged (run() exits immediately without new message)
