"""Failing tests that demonstrate cancellation doesn't work on blocking sync code.

Two manifestations of the same underlying problem — a task blocked inside a
synchronous call (futex / blocking I/O / C-level lock) cannot be cancelled by
asyncio, because ``CancelledError`` can only be delivered at an ``await`` point.
The cleanup code knows this and *tries* to cancel, but gives up after a tiny
timeout, leaving zombie threads that accumulate until the process is killed.

Test 1 — ``AsyncExecutor.close()`` hangs forever on a task blocked in a worker
         thread (the bug addressed by PR #4548).

Test 2 — ``bubus`` EventBus handler timeout logs the error after the timeout
         but the handler's worker thread stays alive forever, because
         ``asyncio.wait_for`` cancels the coroutine but cannot interrupt the
         blocking sync call underneath.  The ``finally`` block only waits 0.1s
         for the cancellation to take effect, then abandons the task.

Both tests fail on ``main`` and should pass once the underlying cancellation
issue is fixed.
