"""Bypass-class regression tests for the shell-parser direction of the
defense-in-depth security analyzer.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The security analyzers currently use regex matching against flattened shell
command text. Regex cannot understand quoting, escaping, or command-name
indirection -- the bypass classes encoded here exist by construction.

Issue #2721 tracks the migration to ``tree-sitter-bash``. Phase 1 (replacing
``bashlex`` in ``openhands-tools``) shipped as #3237. Phase 2 will move the
security analyzers onto the same parser substrate, at which point each
bypass below becomes structurally visible to the detector.

How to read it
--------------
Classes still marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` (command substitution, ANSI-C
quoting) remain out of scope for the first Phase 2b cut: closing them needs
a runtime-decode-or-fail-closed policy decision, tracked as follow-up.

Classes that Phase 2b's first cut closes are asserted as passing:

- ``TestQuotedSegment`` -- quoted command name resolved through de-quoting.
- ``TestPathQualifiedCommand`` -- path prefix reduced to POSIX basename.
- ``TestNestedCommandString`` -- shell-runner ``-c`` operand re-parsed.

``strict=True`` still guards the remaining xfails: an unexpected pass there
fails the build, flagging that a follow-up landed without updating this
catalog.

Scope discipline
----------------
The quoted, path-qualified, and nested-runner classes are asserted as
passing because Phase 2b's first cut resolves them structurally. Their
simplest forms happen to be caught incidentally by the flattened-text
regex, but the class only closes robustly once quoting is combined with
the prefix or nesting; the parametrized cases here exercise those
regex-blind combinations, not just the incidental ones. Bypasses that
remain undecidable without a runtime-decode-or-fail-closed policy
(command substitution, ANSI-C quoting) stay xfail above. Bypasses
undecidable even with AST (semantic base64 decoding, interpreter list
breadth, payloads past ``_EXTRACT_HARD_CAP``) are documented in
``test_adversarial.py`` and are deliberately not duplicated here.
