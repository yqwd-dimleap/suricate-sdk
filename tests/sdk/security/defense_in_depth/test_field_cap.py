"""Tests for primary-field-first extraction ordering.

The extraction pipeline applies a global 30,000-character budget across
all fields. Before this fix, fields were processed in declared order
(tool_name first, thought first), so an oversized earlier field could
starve the primary attack surface of scanning budget and hide it from
every downstream analyzer.

Primary-field-first ordering:
- Exec segments: tool_call.arguments is extracted before tool_name and
  tool_call.name. Arguments is the primary attack surface for indirect
  prompt injection.
- Text segments: summary is extracted before reasoning_content and
  thought. Summary describes the action the agent is about to take.

No per-field truncation is imposed, so no blind spot is created for
pre-cap scanned content: every position that was visible before this
fix remains visible after.

Residual limitation retained from the pre-cap design: content past the
30K total cap within a single field remains invisible (deliberate ReDoS
trade-off).
