"""Tests for ``_compose_conversation_info`` lifting ACP model state.

The chain is:

  1. ``ACPAgent._init`` captures the session's ``current_model_id`` and
     ``available_models`` into PrivateAttrs (because ``AgentBase`` is frozen).
  2. PrivateAttrs don't survive ``model_dump``, so the values can't ride out
     on the serialized ``agent`` field of the API response.
  3. The agent-server lifts them off the live agent instance into top-level
     ``current_model_id`` / ``available_models`` fields on ``ConversationInfo``
     so the downstream Suricate app_server (chip) and the model picker can
     read them — the picker resolves the id to a label from the list itself.

These tests pin down step 3 — that ``_compose_conversation_info`` reads the
attributes off the agent (falling back to persisted ``agent_state``) and
routes them into the response model.
