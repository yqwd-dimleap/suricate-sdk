"""Stress test: listing many conversations.

Bug class this catches:
    - O(N) listing where pagination should be O(page_size).
    - Pagination off-by-one or duplication.
    - Accidental global locks held during list (would serialize concurrent
      list calls and inflate p95).
    - Per-call leaks: listing N times shouldn't grow RSS proportionally.

Why N=2000 and not 10k:
    Going through start_conversation 10k times takes minutes; loading them
    through ``ConversationService.__aenter__`` after that takes minutes
    again. N=2000 still surfaces O(N) regressions strongly while keeping
    the test under a minute.
