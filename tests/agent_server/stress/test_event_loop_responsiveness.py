"""Cross-cutting canary: /health stays responsive under each background load.

Why this exists:
    Most agent-server bugs that cause user-visible "the server hangs" symptoms
    boil down to sync I/O on the asyncio thread. Each individual suite checks
    this in its specific scenario. This canary checks it under a representative
    mix of loads in one place — cheap to add, catches the regression class we
    forgot to test specifically.

Loads exercised:
    - Long bash command (sleep + final marker) — exercises bash_service.
    - Busy conversation listing on a seeded store — exercises persistence.

Loads NOT exercised here (covered by their own suites):
    - Slow webhook (test_slow_webhook.py).
    - Slow-loris websocket (test_slow_websocket_consumer.py).
    - High-volume bash output (test_high_volume_bash_output.py).
