"""Stress test: long-running bash command must not block the event loop.

Bug class this catches:
    - Blocking I/O in the async path during a long bash command (sync subprocess
      calls instead of asyncio.subprocess).
    - Leaked PTYs / zombies after the command finishes or times out.
    - The agent-server losing responsiveness on /health while bash runs.

API gap (documented):
    The bash router exposes ``POST /api/bash/start_bash_command`` (background)
    and ``DELETE /api/bash/bash_events`` (clear all), but **no per-command
    kill/cancel endpoint**. The proposal's "cancel returns < 1s" assertion
    cannot be tested through the public API today. The closest substitute is
    the ``timeout`` field on ExecuteBashRequest, which forces the service to
    SIGKILL the process after a deadline (bash_service.py:274). We exercise
    that code path here. A real cancel endpoint would warrant a separate test.

CI mode:
    ``--stress-quick`` (default): 5s. ``--stress-full`` would bump to 1800s
    per the proposal. We don't gate on the long path here; that's a
    separate workflow.
