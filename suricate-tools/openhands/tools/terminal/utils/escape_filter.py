"""Filter terminal query sequences from captured output.

When CLI tools (like `gh`, `npm`, etc.) run inside a PTY, they may send
terminal query sequences as part of their progress/spinner UI. These queries
get captured as output. When displayed, the terminal processes them and
responds, causing visible escape code garbage.

This module provides filtering to remove these query sequences while
preserving legitimate formatting escape codes (colors, bold, etc.).

NOTE: This module only handles queries captured from PTY output (commands
run via the terminal tool). SDK-side queries (e.g., Rich library capability
detection) are not addressed here and would require filtering at the
conversation/visualizer boundary.

See: https://github.com/yqwd-dimleap/suricate-sdk/issues/2244
