"""ACP provider registry — single source of truth for built-in provider metadata.

Each record captures the static properties that are known at configuration time
(before any subprocess is launched):

- ``key``                   settings discriminator (``ACPAgentSettings.acp_server``)
- ``display_name``          human-readable label for UI display
- ``default_command``       default ``npx``-based launch command
- ``api_key_env_var``       env var the subprocess expects for its API key
- ``base_url_env_var``      env var for proxy/base-URL routing (or ``None``)
- ``default_session_mode``  ACP mode ID that disables permission prompts,
                            or ``None`` when the server has no such mode
- ``agent_name_patterns``   lowercase substrings in the runtime agent name;
                            used by ``ACPAgent`` to auto-detect mode / protocol
- ``supports_set_session_model``  whether the provider applies its *initial*
                                  model via a protocol call at session creation
                                  (``set_config_option``/``set_session_model``)
- ``supports_runtime_model_switch``  whether the server supports a protocol-level
                                  model switch for runtime, mid-conversation use
- ``session_meta_key``      top-level ``_meta`` key for model selection (or ``None``)
- ``available_models``      curated list of selectable models for the provider's
                            model picker (``acp_model`` candidates)
- ``default_model``         model preselected when none is configured (or ``None``)
- ``file_secrets``          reserved "file-content" credential secrets the
                            provider authenticates from (Codex ``auth.json``,
                            Gemini Vertex SA JSON); see :class:`ACPFileSecretSpec`

Callers outside the SDK (e.g. ``openhands-agent-server``, the ``Suricate``
frontend, and the ``@openhands/typescript-client`` mirror) can import
:data:`ACP_PROVIDERS` and :func:`get_acp_provider` instead of maintaining their
own copies of this metadata.
