"""Cleanup profile: repair an agent's outward text before a human reads it.

An agent's reasoning can be sound while the *surface* of a message is broken —
mojibake from mis-encoded emoji, stray control characters, or an inconsistent
format for the target channel. The big reasoning model should not have to police
its own output every turn.

This module runs the agent's outward text through a small, saved LLM profile —
resolved by convention under the name ``cleanup`` (:data:`CLEANUP_PROFILE_NAME`) —
and returns the repaired text. It mirrors the ``ask_oracle`` pattern: no agent
setting and no wiring; a caller saves a profile named ``cleanup`` and calls
:func:`clean_outward_text` (or the async :func:`aclean_outward_text`).

The pass is deliberately narrow:

- It runs on outward, human-facing text only. Callers must not use it on internal
  agent or tool messages.
- It is stateless: only the cleanup system prompt plus the draft are sent, with
  no conversation history and no tools. The active conversation LLM is never
  switched.
- It repairs the surface only. The prompt forbids adding facts, links, or
  promises; it must not change meaning.
- It fails open. If no ``cleanup`` profile exists, or the call errors, the
  original text is returned unchanged.
