"""AST-backed shell-command detection for the pattern analyzer.

Resolves command names structurally against the shared tree-sitter
``_shell_ast`` view (issue #2721, Phase 2b) so that quoted, path-qualified,
and nested command names become visible to the recursive force-delete
detector. Only that family is scanned here; injection and Python-code
patterns stay as regex in ``pattern.py`` because they are not shell syntax.

The scanner reports ``uncertain`` -- so the analyzer can emit ``UNKNOWN``
rather than a false ``LOW``, the ensemble convention agreed in #2721
(UNKNOWN fails safe under ``ConfirmRisky``) -- whenever it cannot vouch for
what it saw:

- the destructive flag shape appears on a command whose verb cannot be
  resolved (an opaque or dynamic name);
- an ERROR/MISSING parse node intersects a span the detection relies on (a
  command carrying the destructive flag shape, or a shell runner's argv);
- the nested-runner depth bound is hit with a script operand still
  unscanned.

Benign text that merely fails to parse as shell is not treated as
uncertain: parse errors outside the spans above stay LOW, because arbitrary
non-shell text routinely fails to parse and surfacing every such error
would flood the ensemble with UNKNOWNs. Detector IDs are owned by
``pattern.py`` and passed in unchanged.
