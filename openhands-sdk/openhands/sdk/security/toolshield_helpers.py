"""Helpers for populating ``ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer.safety_experiences``.

These helpers integrate with the ``toolshield`` PyPI package (install via the
``[toolshield]`` optional extra). They expose four usage patterns:

1. :func:`safety_experiences_for_mcp_config` -- **recommended for SDK
   agents**: derive the tool surface from the agent's own
   ``AgentBase.mcp_config`` plus its explicit tool list (no network
   probing; works for stdio servers and built-in tools like
   ``FileEditorTool``).
2. :func:`default_safety_experiences` -- seed with terminal + filesystem
   experiences we ship by default.
3. :func:`load_safety_experiences` -- load an explicit list of tool
   experiences.
4. :func:`auto_detect_safety_experiences` -- probe localhost for active MCP
   servers, load experiences for the tools that are actually running. A
   developer convenience for exploratory setups where no ``mcp_config`` is
   at hand; prefer :func:`safety_experiences_for_mcp_config` in server or
   agent processes.

All four return a rendered string ready to plug into
``ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(safety_experiences=...)``. Users who want to
inject their own hand-authored experiences can skip these helpers and pass
an arbitrary string directly.

Example:
    >>> from openhands.sdk.security import ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer
    >>> from openhands.sdk.security.toolshield_helpers import (
    ...     default_safety_experiences,
    ...     auto_detect_safety_experiences,
    ...     safety_experiences_for_mcp_config,
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Default seed
    >>> analyzer = ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(
    ...     llm=guardrail_llm,
    ...     safety_experiences=default_safety_experiences(),
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Auto-detect whatever MCP servers are running locally
    >>> analyzer = ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(
    ...     llm=guardrail_llm,
    ...     safety_experiences=auto_detect_safety_experiences(),
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Or, preferred for SDK agents: match the agent's configured
    >>> # servers and explicit tools
    >>> analyzer = ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(
    ...     llm=guardrail_llm,
    ...     safety_experiences=safety_experiences_for_mcp_config(
    ...         agent.mcp_config,
    ...         tool_names=[t.name for t in agent.tools],
    ...     ),
    ... )
