"""Dynamic-tier prompt sections.

These render per-conversation content (datetime, repo context, available skills,
custom suffix, secrets) into the ``DYNAMIC`` block. All inputs are resolved into the
:class:`PromptContext` before assembly (skills gated by model family, secrets merged),
so the sections stay pure -- no Jinja, no I/O. ``refine()`` is deliberately not applied
here: rewriting user-provided repo/skill/suffix text is the post-render hack the
registry is replacing (proposal #2827).
