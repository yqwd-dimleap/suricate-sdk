"""Two-tier persistent-memory loader.

Reads the agent-maintained ``MEMORY.md`` indexes -- ``~/.openhands/memory/``
(user tier) and ``<workspace>/.openhands/memory/`` (project tier) -- into one
prompt-ready string. LocalConversation resolves this on the first
``send_message()`` / ``run()`` (the workspace path is unknown when AgentContext
validates); AgentContext only carries the resolved text. Daily logs
(``YYYY-MM-DD.md``) in the same directories are deliberately NOT loaded -- the
agent reads them on demand.
