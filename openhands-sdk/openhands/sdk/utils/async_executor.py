# — that value predates the lifecycle-lock path and is too long for teardown

        Semantics
        ---------
        This is **bounded, best-effort shutdown, not guaranteed cleanup.**

        - It first cancels any remaining portal tasks (``portal.stop(True)``)
          and then waits up to ``timeout`` seconds for the portal thread to
          exit.
        - If the portal thread is stuck on work that does *not* honour
          cancellation — for example a task awaiting inside a worker thread,
          which anyio cannot interrupt until the thread returns (see #4598) —
          the wait expires and the helper thread is **abandoned**. The portal
          thread is a daemon, so the process can still exit; but the thread
          and any resources it holds (subprocess handles, sockets, file
          descriptors) may remain alive until process exit. This is a
          deliberate trade-off: blocking the caller forever is worse.
        - The shutdown path is non-raising. Failures inside the portal
          teardown are logged (with traceback) and swallowed so that
          ``close()`` is always safe to call from a destructor or
          ``__exit__``.
        - **Idempotent.** Calling ``close()`` on an already-closed executor
          is a no-op.

        Args:
            timeout: seconds to wait for the portal thread to exit. ``None``
                waits indefinitely (the previous, pre-#4548 behaviour) and
                is kept only for compatibility — **do not use it on any
                production path**, since it reintroduces the unbounded hang
                this fix exists to prevent. See PR #4548 / issue #4598.
