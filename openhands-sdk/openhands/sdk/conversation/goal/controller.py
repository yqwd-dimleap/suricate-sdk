"""The transport-agnostic brain of the ``/goal`` loop.

``GoalController`` decides -- after each agent run finishes -- whether to
continue (with a followup message) or stop (with a ``GoalOutcome``). It performs
NO I/O: a *driver* (the sync ``run_goal``, or an async agent-server task) owns
sending messages and running the agent; the controller only judges and decides.
That split lets the sync and async drivers share identical decision logic.
