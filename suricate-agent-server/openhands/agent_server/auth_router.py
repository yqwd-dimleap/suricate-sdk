"""Workspace static-server cookie auth endpoints.

Browsers cannot attach custom headers to ``<iframe src>``, ``<img src>`` or
top-level navigation requests, so the workspace static file server cannot
be authenticated by the ``X-Session-API-Key`` header alone when the canvas
frontend wants to embed workspace artifacts (HTML reports, plots, PDFs).

These endpoints let a client that already has a valid session API key
exchange it for a short-lived cookie which the browser will automatically
attach to every workspace request — including cross-site iframes, thanks
to ``SameSite=None; Secure; Partitioned``.

The cookie is honored by ``workspace_router`` ONLY. Every other API route
continues to require the ``X-Session-API-Key`` header. This is deliberate:
keeping cookies off the rest of the API removes the CSRF surface that
cookie auth would otherwise add.
