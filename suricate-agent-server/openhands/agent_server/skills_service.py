"""Skills service for Suricate Agent Server.

This module contains the business logic for skill loading and management,
keeping the router clean and focused on HTTP concerns.

Skill Sources:
- Public skills: registered marketplace plugins or GitHub Suricate/extensions
- User skills: ~/.suricate/skills/ and ~/.suricate/microagents/
- Project skills: {workspace}/.suricate/skills/, .cursorrules, agents.md
- Organization skills: {org}/.openhands or {org}/openhands-config
- Sandbox skills: Exposed URLs from sandbox environment

Precedence (later overrides earlier):
sandbox < registered marketplace/public < user < org < project

        directly from async code without wrapping it in asyncio.to_thread().
