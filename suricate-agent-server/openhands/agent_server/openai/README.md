# OpenAI-compatible gateway

This package contains the agent-server implementation for the OpenAI-compatible API surface under `/v1`.

- `router.py` defines the FastAPI routes and maps OpenAI-style bearer authentication to the existing session key mechanism.
- `models.py` contains the small server-side request models and aliases the reusable OpenAI response models.
- `service.py` translates Chat Completions and Responses requests into Suricate
  conversations, waits for completion, and returns OpenAI-shaped responses.

`POST /v1/responses` implements the stateless client flow: every request starts a
fresh Suricate conversation, and clients carry context forward by replaying
input and output items with `store: false`. `previous_response_id` is rejected
until the gateway can preserve exact response-turn lineage and branching
semantics.

Not yet supported on the Responses surface:

- `previous_response_id` is rejected with `400`; replay input items instead.
- `store: true` is rejected with `400` because the gateway does not retain a
  retrievable Responses object or implement `GET /v1/responses/{id}`. The
  backing Suricate conversation still follows the agent-server's normal
  persistence policy, so `store: false` is not a data-retention control.
- `stream: true` is rejected with `400` (typed streaming events are follow-up
  scope).
- `tools`, `tool_choice`, and `parallel_tool_calls` are accepted but ignored;
  Suricate tool execution stays internal to the agent. `temperature` and other
  generation-tuning fields are likewise ignored. These are dropped rather than
  rejected because they do not break the stateless default flow, but clients
  should not rely on them having an effect.

The gateway intentionally stays separate from the native agent-server routers so the OpenAI compatibility layer can evolve without mixing protocol translation code into the core REST API modules.
