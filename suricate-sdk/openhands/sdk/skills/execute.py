"""Command execution for dynamic skill context injection.

Supports inline !`command` syntax in skill content. Commands are executed
at render time and their output replaces the placeholder.

Safety rules:
- Fenced (```) and inline (`) code blocks are preserved, never executed.
- An unclosed fenced block (odd number of ```) extends to EOF, protecting
  any trailing content from accidental execution.
- Use \\!`cmd` to produce the literal text !`cmd` without execution.

**Security Warning**: Commands are executed via shell with full process
privileges. Only use with trusted skill sources.
