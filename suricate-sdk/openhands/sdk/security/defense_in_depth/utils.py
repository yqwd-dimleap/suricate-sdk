"""Extraction and normalization for action-boundary security analysis.

Before an agent action can be classified as safe or dangerous, two
things need to happen: the right content must be extracted from the
ActionEvent (extraction), and encoding tricks that hide dangerous
commands must be neutralized (normalization).

Extraction controls the attack surface. Fields not extracted are
invisible to every downstream layer. Two corpora are maintained:
the *executable corpus* (what the agent will do) and the *text corpus*
(what it thought about). Shell-destructive patterns only see the
first; injection patterns see both.

Normalization collapses invisible characters, control codes, and
fullwidth substitutions so that ``r\\u200bm`` matches ``rm`` and
``\\uff52\\uff4d`` matches ``rm`` before any pattern is tested.

These are internal helpers (underscore-prefixed, not re-exported).
