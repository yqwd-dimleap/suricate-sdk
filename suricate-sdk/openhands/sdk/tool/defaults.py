"""Canonical default tool names for the standard Suricate agent.

Tool *names* are a wire contract: they are persisted in settings/profile JSON
and sent by clients, independently of where the implementations live. Keeping
the canonical defaults here lets ``suricate-sdk`` (which must not import
``suricate-tools``) default a toolset from data alone — ``Tool`` is a spec
(name + params) resolved to an implementation only at runtime via the registry.

``openhands.tools.preset.default.get_default_tools`` remains the constructor
that also registers the implementations; ``tests/cross`` asserts it stays in
lockstep with these names.
