"""Release security check #1 — approval drift (a TOCTOU guard).

The window we care about: a human reviews a PR (time-of-check), but what is
actually merged and shipped (time-of-use) is not what they reviewed — because
commits were pushed after approval, or the PR was merged with no human approval
at all (e.g. auto-merge, or an agent acting on an injected review comment).

For every PR merged into this line of history since the last release tag, this
compares the PR's merged head against its last *human* APPROVED review:

  * merged with **no human approval**            -> blocking
  * commits pushed **after** the last approval    -> blocking (the reviewed
    diff is not the shipped diff)

Deterministic: reads ``git log`` for the merged-PR list and the read-only
GitHub REST API for reviews. It never runs the PR's code.

Env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN       (recommended; raises rate limits, reads private repos)
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY  (owner/name; falls back to the origin remote)
  SECURITY_SCAN_BASELINE_TAG  (optional; overrides the auto-detected last tag)
  SECURITY_SCAN_TRUSTED_BOTS  (optional CSV of bot logins whose merges are
                               allowed without human approval, e.g. dependabot)
