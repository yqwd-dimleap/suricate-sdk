"""ACP npm installation catalog — the single source of truth for each
built-in provider's pinned npm package(s), CLI entry point, and any launch
arguments needed to invoke it.

Deliberately dependency-free (stdlib only, no pydantic): the agent-server
Dockerfile's ``acp-providers`` stage builds from a bare ``python:*-bookworm``
image with no Suricate package installed, so this file is COPYed into that
stage on its own and executed with the system ``python3`` to render the ACP
payload's npm-install/wrapper plan (see :func:`render_docker_install_plan` and
the ``acp-providers`` stage in
``openhands-agent-server/openhands/agent_server/docker/Dockerfile``). It must
keep working when imported (or run as a script) with nothing beyond the
standard library on ``sys.path``.

:data:`ACP_PROVIDERS` in ``acp_providers.py`` builds each provider's
``default_command``/``binary_name`` from this catalog, so a package/version
bump only needs to happen here.
