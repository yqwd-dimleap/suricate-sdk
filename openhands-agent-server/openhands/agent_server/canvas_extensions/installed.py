"""Installed Canvas Extensions.

Built on ``openhands.sdk.extensions.installation``, shared with Plugins/
Skills, with two behaviors specific to this module:

Disabled by default -- ``InstallationInfo.enabled`` defaults to ``True``
and neither ``InstallationManager.install()`` nor its directory discovery
override that for a new entry, so every write path that can create one
forces ``enabled=False`` as an explicit post-write step.

Staged refresh -- ``check``/``apply`` replace ``update()``/
``install(force=True)``, which rmtree+copytree straight onto the live
install path with no staging directory. ``check`` fetches and validates
into ``.staging/`` without touching the active install; ``apply`` swaps it
in via two atomic renames (POSIX can't atomically replace a non-empty
directory in one rename), rolling back if the second fails.
