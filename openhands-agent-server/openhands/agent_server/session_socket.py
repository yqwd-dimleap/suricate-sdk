"""``/sockets/session/{conversation_id}`` — the session socket.

Fixes three things the legacy ``/sockets/events/{id}`` endpoint gets wrong,
without touching it: frames are envelopes rather than the disk record; history
and live traffic cannot interleave; and a slow consumer cannot wedge the
publisher, because admission is byte-bounded and only this connection's writer
task awaits the socket.
