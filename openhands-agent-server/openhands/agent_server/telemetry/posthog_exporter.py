"""Optional PostHog exporter. The only vendor-aware module in the tree.

``posthog`` is imported lazily inside :meth:`PostHogExporter.__init__` so that
importing this package — or running the server with telemetry disabled — never
pulls the dependency in. Library and headless consumers therefore pay nothing,
and a missing extra degrades to the no-op sink instead of crashing startup.

**This exporter calls ``capture()`` and nothing else.** No ``identify()``, no
``alias()``, no ``group_identify()``, no ``$set``. The reasons, in order of
severity:

1. ``identify()`` creates or mutates a *person profile* that the hosting
   product (Canvas) already owns. A second writer clobbers its properties, and
   any drift in ``distinct_id`` (email vs uuid) mints a duplicate person that
   is billed as a second monthly active user.
2. ``alias()`` is irreversible in PostHog — a single mistake permanently
   merges two identities.
3. Person profiles turn cheap events into billed ones, and these are
   diagnostics rather than per-person product usage.

Correlation is achieved by *reusing* the identity the deployment already
established, never by asserting a new one.
