"""Wire protocol for ``/sockets/session/{conversation_id}``.

Not built on ``Event``: the legacy endpoint sends the same class it persists
and validates, and ``Event`` is ``extra="forbid"``, so every wire field would
be a storage migration. Here ``Event`` rides inside an envelope, untouched,
and protocol fields live on the envelope.

The URL is the protocol version — no handshake, no ``protocol`` field.

Delivery rules:

1. ``Durable`` survives a reconnect via ``after_seq``; within a connection it
   may be dropped, which is what lets a slow consumer be disconnected instead
   of blocking the publisher.
2. ``Delta`` may be dropped freely; a gap marks the slot lossy and the real
   text arrives with the durable message.
3. Every ``ItemStarted`` is retired by exactly one ``Durable`` or
   ``ItemAborted``. ``item_id`` *is* the finished message's ``Event.id``, so a
   client closes a slot on ``frame.event.id == slot.item_id``.
4. Progress frames are never replayed.
5. No ordering is promised between two open items.
