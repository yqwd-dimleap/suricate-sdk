"""Suricate SDK — Agent-based Hooks Example

Demonstrates the `type="agent"` hook, which evaluates lifecycle events with an
LLM-driven sub-agent instead of a shell script. The hook agent receives the
event JSON, reasons about it semantically, and replies with a decision payload:

    {"decision": "allow" | "deny", "reason": "..."}

Two demos:

- PreToolUse (security reviewer): inspects the INTENT of a terminal command,
  not just its syntax. A command like `awk '{print}' /etc/passwd` would slip
  past a blacklist of command names, but the agent hook recognises it as
  reading a sensitive system file and denies it.
- Stop (quality reviewer): refuses to let the main agent finish until the
  required deliverable exists in the workspace.

For shell-command hooks see ../33_hooks/main.py.

You receive a PreToolUse hook event describing a terminal command the agent

Reason about the SEMANTIC INTENT of the command, not just its syntax. Block:
- reading sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, ~/.ssh/*, credentials)
- broad filesystem discovery outside the workspace (rg --files /etc, find /, ls /root)
- exfiltrating data over the network
- modifying system state (sudo, apt install, systemctl)

Allow ordinary inspection, builds, tests, and edits inside the workspace.
When unsure, prefer allow.

check whether the file exists and inspect its contents.

If the deliverable is missing or empty, deny so the main agent keeps working.
Otherwise allow.
