"""Structured output via ``response_schema``.

Attach a Pydantic model to *any* tool spec and the agent must populate those
fields when calling that tool. The schema is sent to the LLM as the tool's
JSON-schema parameters and validated on receipt.

Demonstrated here on two tools:
  - ``TerminalTool`` (existing SDK tool) — every command must come with a
    ``purpose`` and ``expected_outcome``, on top of the tool's own ``command``
    field. No subclassing required: the schema is merged in via the spec.
  - ``FinishTool`` (built-in) — the final answer comes back as a typed object.
