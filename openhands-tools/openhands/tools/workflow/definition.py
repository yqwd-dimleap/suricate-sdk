_WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION: Final[
    str
] = """Run a dynamic workflow written as Python orchestration code.

Use this tool for large tasks that benefit from parallel sub-agents, such as
codebase-wide audits, independent plan reviews, security sweeps, or discovery
work where intermediate results should stay outside the main conversation.

Provide a Python script that defines exactly this entry point:

```python
async def main(wf):
    ...
```

The script coordinates sub-agents through the `wf` object. It should not read or
write files, run shell commands, or perform the engineering work directly.
Sub-agents should do that work through their normal Suricate tools and security
policy. Scripts should use only the documented `wf` methods; private `wf`
attributes are rejected. Large reducer inputs may be truncated before being sent
to the reducer sub-agent.

Available `wf` methods:
- `await wf.run_agent(prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose", description=None)`
- `await wf.map_agents(items, prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose",
  max_concurrency=None, description=None)`
- `await wf.reduce_agent(items, prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description=None)`
- `await wf.pipeline(items, *stages)` — run each item through all stages with no
  barrier between stages (a fast item reaches a later stage while a slow item is
  still in an earlier one). The first stage gets the item; each later stage gets
  the previous result. Stages may be sync or async. A stage that raises drops that
  item to `None`. Prefer this over chained `map_agents` calls when per-item stages
  are independent, since `map_agents` fully drains each stage before the next.
- `wf.flatten(values)` — flatten one level of nesting (not recursive)

`subagent_type` must be a sub-agent type registered in the parent application.
Use the same type names you registered when building your agent.

Scripts must use only the documented `wf` methods listed above; calling
`wf.close()` or any other undocumented attribute is not supported.

`print()` is available for debugging but writes to the server logs, not to
the workflow observation seen by the LLM; use the return value of `main()` to
surface results.

If one or more `map_agents` items fail, the whole call raises an
`ExceptionGroup`. The name `ExceptionGroup` is not available by name in the
workflow sandbox, so scripts cannot use `except*` for selective group handling.
A plain `except Exception` will still catch the entire group. To handle partial
failures and collect all results, design sub-agent prompts to return an error
sentinel value instead of raising.

`map_agents` accepts either a callable prompt, such as
`lambda item: f"Review this finding: {item}"`, or a string template containing
`{item}`.

Example:
```python
async def main(wf):
    strategies = ["minimal fix", "test-first", "security-focused"]
    plans = await wf.map_agents(
        items=strategies,
        subagent_type="general-purpose",
        max_concurrency=3,
        prompt=lambda strategy: f"Create a plan using this strategy: {strategy}",
    )
    critiques = await wf.map_agents(
        items=plans,
        subagent_type="code-reviewer",
        prompt=lambda plan: f"Adversarially critique this plan: {plan}",
    )
    return await wf.reduce_agent(
        items={"plans": plans, "critiques": critiques},
        prompt="Synthesize the safest and simplest final plan.",
    )
```

running a workflow as approving generated code execution.
